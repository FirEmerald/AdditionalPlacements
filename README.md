# Vertical Slabs and Stairs
Framework and implementation for vertical slabs and stairs

Features:
 - no added items - vertical slabs and stairs are extensions of the existing slab and stair block placement logic
 - simple datagen helpers to generate blockstates, block models, and item models for modded slabs and stairs
 - does not interfere with the operation of slabs and stairs that lack a vertical variant
