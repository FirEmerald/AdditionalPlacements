# Additional Placements
Framework and implementation for additional placement states for certain blocks

Features:  
 - no added items - additional placements are extensions of the existing slab and stair block placement logic  
 - supports slabs and stairs (vertical) and carpet and pressure plates (on walls and ceiling)
 - vertical stairs actually connnect to other stairs (and vice-versa)
 - supports most modded blocks
 - simple datagen helpers to generate blockstates, block models, and item models for modded blocks, in case extra compatibility is needed
